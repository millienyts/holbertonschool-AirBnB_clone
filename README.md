# AirBnB clone - The console

## Description
This project is a part of the AirBnB clone project, focusing on building a command-line interface (CLI) to manage AirBnB objects. The CLI allows users to interact with the application by creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting objects like User, State, City, Place, etc. 

## Command Interpreter
The command interpreter provides the following functionalities:

- Creating a new object
- Retrieving an object from a file or database
- Performing operations on objects (e.g., counting, computing stats)
- Updating attributes of an object
- Destroying an object


### How to Start
To start the command interpreter, execute the `console.py` script in the terminal.


### How to Use
Once the command interpreter is running, you can use the following commands:

- `create`: Creates a new instance of a specified class.
- `show`: Displays the details of a specific instance based on class name and ID.
- `destroy`: Deletes a specific instance based on class name and ID.
- `all`: Displays details of all instances or instances of a specific class.
- `update`: Updates attributes of a specific instance.
 
## Requirements
### Python Scripts
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc
- All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
- All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
- A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)

### Python Unit Tests
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files should end with a new line
- All your test files should be inside a folder tests
- You have to use the unittest module
- All your test files should be python files (extension: .py)
- All your test files and folders should start by test_
- Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project
- All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m unittest discover tests
- All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
- All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
- We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case

### GitHub
- There should be one project repository per group.

## Execution
Your shell should work like this in interactive mode:

$ ./console.py
